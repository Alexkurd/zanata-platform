  # Specify the type of quotes that are acceptable to use in JSX attributes.
  # Standard enforces single-quotes, but we discussed this in our team and
  # decided that it makes more sense to be consistent with other markup by using
  # double-quotes for attributes.

  #   import * as React from 'react'
